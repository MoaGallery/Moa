Moa was created by Rich Talbutt and Dan Brown as the available open source 
offerings didn't fit what we wanted.  We just wanted something reasonably 
simple to put photos and images up for friends/family to see and did not need 
or want things like private galleries per-user or comments, polls, email, etc.  
As we didn't find anything suitable we wrote our own and decided others might 
like it as well. There is still a lot left to do, see TODO for details of what 
we have planned.
