  Bugs -
    When add-tag dialogue is up, can tab to controls behind.
    Possible IE6 bug - Layers not in correct order for popup add tag dialogues (IE7 and Firefox are ok)
    IE6 not laying out thumbnails correctly.
    
  To Verify as fixed -
    Thumbnails of varying height prevent other thumbnails from lining up correctly on gallery view.
    
  Fixed -
    Some special chars don't display correctly in popups.
    HTML Injection is possible for gallery title and description
