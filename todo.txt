Bugs -
  Bugs -
    IE6 not laying out thumbnails correctly.
    Quotes not being stripped out in descriptions.
    Slashes in gallery description can multiply on edit.
    '#' symbol in title causes problems (blank description and/or not saved at all).
    Multiline comments on add image display \n\r instead performing a CR/LF.
    Gallery/image titles can be too long to fit on the preview without messing up the layout.
    IE6 - need to specify the logo size.
    View image full size link sometimes has random crap in.
    
  To Verify as fixed -
    Thumbnails of varying height prevent other thumbnails from lining up correctly on gallery view.
    
  Fixed -
    Some special chars don't display correctly in popups.
    HTML Injection is possible for gallery title and description
    If no images in a gallery, show a message
    Editting + adding a desc with a '#' in doesn't save the desc.
    Overlib shouldn't display when no description
    Navigation Tree does not update when you change a gallery title.
    Page titles needs spacing.
    Sometimes complains about Gallery ID when submitting a gallery edit.
