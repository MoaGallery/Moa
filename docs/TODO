    Aperture - popup appears on top left if page is loaded with thumbnail under the mouse.
Bugs -
    Euros plus possibly other characters in the parent combo box stop javascript classes from loading.  (Gallery) - Unable to reproduce, old?
    galleryfuncs stuff returns false if it fails, we need to check it.
 
 
 
 
 
Done -
    'Home' on breadcrumb should go to index, not gallery_id 0000000000 (same for deleting level 1 sub-gallery) - fixed.
    Cookie path invalid for apache redirected URLS - fixed.
    Sitemap node should insert just 1 variable width spacer. Not 1 div per indent level - fixed.
    Make logo clickable - done.
    Check sitemap with no galleries - fixed.
    Remove new english words (I.E IERROR) from error messages before displaying - done.
    Remove unused CSS classes - done.
    Darkroom header branding.
    Gallery edit screws up styles - fixed.
    Uploading a big image hangs on uploading. No error or indication of what is going on - fixed.
