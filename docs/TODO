    Image thumbnails need a container moatag (aperture needs it for <ul>s).
Bugs -
    galleryfuncs stuff returns false if it fails, we need to check it.
    Popup appears on top left if page is loaded with thumbnail under the mouse.
    Moadefault - long image descriptions expand the desc box and gets pushed below due to the float: left;
    Tags containing the seperator char are broken up on the tag admin page. Should be replaced.
	Replacing an image with a different sized file will keep the old dimensions in the DB.
    
Fixed -
    * Changing template to Aperture shows an error about 2 settings not being done.  
	* Showing thumbs+galleries isn't showing the galleries.
	* Handle thumbnail sizes.
	* Add gallery - labels wrong colour.
 
 
 
 
 
Done -
    Make Sure all path variables terminate with a '/'
    Let parsers return false for no output and check with ===. (and all mod_x.php param getters)
