==== ABOUT ====

Moa is an image gallery website system written in PHP and using MySQL for data 
storage. It is released as Open Source under the zlib/libpng license. This 
allows pretty much any usage as long as you don't claim that you wrote it.

The intended use is for websites that want a gallery but do not want the 
complexity and extended feature set of some of the heavier-duty open source 
galleries. It is purposefully designed to not require registration/login (apart 
from admins), has no comments/ratings and provide just one shared set of 
galleries. Our reasoning for these is that someone putting up pictures of their 
pet or holiday on a personal homepage usually won't care about feedback.

However that doesn't mean the site-owner doesn't need decent tools and we 
provide some of these (with more to come). "Tags", or keywords, are given to 
all galleries and images and are the way the site knows where to put each 
image. This allows a hierarchical gallery structure and allows images to appear 
in more than one gallery without re-uploading. Galleries can be made and will 
auto-populate with any images that have matching tags. Adding, editting and 
deleting galleries/images is easy.

We chose the name Moa for two reasons. Firstly, there wasn't another project 
with the same name. Secondly it was meant to represent that things are not 
eternal. Once holidays, pets or giant extinct birds are gone, the images and 
memories are all we have left. And again, the name was free...

==== KNOWN ISSUES ====

Server limits. Apache can set limits on both uploaded file size and how much 
memory it uses. For regular internet images this probably won't be a problem 
but if you want to host high-resolution images it can be. Our own hosts have 
a limit of 32Mb memory due to shared hosting which means we can't upload a 
file bigger than about 7 megapixels but it is probably rare you would want 
to upload one that big. Moa currently does not have a check for this, although 
it is something we want to add sooner rather than later.
