 1 ==== BEFORE YOU INSTALL ====

   Moa needs the following to be able to install and run correctly -
   
   MySQL 5.0.1 or higher
   Apache 2.0 or higher
   PHP 5.2 or higher
   PHP extension - gd2
   PHP extension - mbstring
   
   A database and user set up in MySQL.  The user needs basic priviledges such 
   as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.  For the install the user also needs 
   CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW and ALTER privs.  See later for a workaround if 
   your host does not allow a new user to be granted these (CPanel-based hosts 
   for example do not seem to allow CREATE VIEW).



 2 ==== INSTALLATION ====

1. Upload the Moa files to the server you want to use, or copy it into the web
   server path for a local install.  If using a unix-based OS make sure your
   web-server user has read/write permissions in the moa directory.

2. Open install.php in a browser.  It should guide you though the installation.

3. If it all goes ok, make sure you delete or rename the install.php 
   afterwards.  Moa will warn you if it is still there.

4. Moa should now work by opening the index.php file in a browser.

5. Feel free to send feedback if you think we need to include more or less info
   here (or about Moa in general).



 3 ==== WORKAROUNDS / PROBLEMS ====

1. Database User doesn't have CREATE VIEW privs in MySQL.  When the install 
   tries to create the data tables it complains that only 15 statements ran out 
   of 19 or 21.  We have seen this with our host that uses CPanel and it is due 
   to created database users not having enough priviledges to create views. 

   There are two workarounds we know of -

    i)  Use your main login (i.e. CPanel) name and password to install Moa as
        this should have those privs.  After it is installed, edit config.php 
        in the Moa root and change the user name/password to the new database 
        user you created for Moa.
   
    ii) Allow the install to complete and add the missing 4 statements by 
        hand.  Open the file SQL/gallery-create-view.sql in a text editor and 
        replace each occurence of <prefix> with whatever table prefix you chose 
        during the Moa install (default is 'moa_').  Then execute each of the 4 
        statements in whatever database admin tool you have access to (usually 
        PHPMyAdmin or similar).  This usually uses your main login to run so 
        should put the views in place.
   
2. Thumbnails are not created.  The gd2 PHP extension can come in several
   versions.  The one we have confirmed works has 'bundled (2.0.34 compatible)' 
   in it's description using phpinfo().  The 2.0.34 version by itself didn't 
   seem to work when I installed it in Linux.
   
   
   
 4 ==== UPGRADE ====
 
1. Upload the new Moa files over the top of the old ones. It is ok to overwrite
   the old versions. There is no need to upload/copy install.php as it is not
   required and will only need to be deleted again to stop the reminders.

2. Open Moa in a browser and login. A message at the top will prompt you to
   complete the upgrade. Click it to continue.

3. Hit the 'Complete upgrade' button to finish the process. Depending on the
   version this stage will add new configuration variables, delete outdated
   Moa files and/or make database changes.
