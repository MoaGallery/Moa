 1 ==== BEFORE YOU INSTALL ====

   Moa needs the following to be able to install and run correctly -
   
   MySQL 5.0.1 or higher
   Apache 2.0 or higher
   PHP 5.2 or higher
   PHP extension - gd2 (should say "bundled" on the version)
   PHP extension - mbstring
   
   A database and user set up in MySQL.  The user needs basic priviledges such 
   as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.  For the install/upgrade the user
   also needs CREATE TABLE and ALTER privs.



 2 ==== INSTALLATION ====

1. Upload the Moa files to the server you want to use, or copy it into the web
   server path for a local install.  If using a unix-based OS make sure your
   web-server user has read/write permissions in the moa directory (need to
   write to config.php, private/db_config.php, images dir and images/thumbs dir).

2. Open install.php in a browser.  It should guide you though the installation.

3. If it all goes ok, make sure you delete or rename the install.php 
   afterwards.  Moa will warn you if it is still there.

4. Moa should now work by opening the index.php file in a browser.

5. Feel free to send feedback if you think we need to include more or less info
   here (or about Moa in general).



 3 ==== WORKAROUNDS / PROBLEMS ====

1. Thumbnails are not created.  The gd2 PHP extension can come in several
   versions.  The one we have confirmed works has 'bundled' in it's description
   using phpinfo().  The 2.0.34 version by itself didn't seem to work when I
   installed it in Linux.
   
   
   
 4 ==== UPGRADE ====
 
1. Upload the new Moa files over the top of the old ones. It is ok to overwrite
   the old versions. There is no need to upload/copy install.php as it is not
   required and will only need to be deleted again to stop the reminders.

2. Open Moa in a browser and login. A message at the top will prompt you to
   complete the upgrade. Click it to continue.

3. Hit the 'Complete upgrade' button to finish the process. Depending on the
   version this stage will add new configuration variables, delete outdated
   Moa files and/or make database changes. Make sure config.php is writable
   by the web server user first.
